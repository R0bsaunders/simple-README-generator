## Description
The readme file is an essential part of any project / repository. Yet, it can often be one of the most tedious can't it? You've spent all that time conceptualising, designing and coding your project, and the last thing you want to do is create a readme file. I have solved this problem with this simple tool that will allow you to generate a README.md file with a title, description, installation, Usage, License type, contributing, testing and how to ask questions instructions all using the command line. And to prove it works, I created this very Readme using it :-) ! Readme file in minutes!

This app makes use of inquirer and fs to function

## Installation
To install this app, simply download the files to your system and put them where you need them. This can be on your local machine or a server.

## Usage
To use, open your terminal and navigate to the root folder. Simply type 'node index.js' to launch the generator. you will be presented with a series of questions, follow them one-by-one until you are presented with the success message and a README.md file is automatically added to the assets folder. You may wish to make sure the assets folder does not already contain a previously generated README.md file. It doesn't matter if it does because the generator will only ever overwrite the contents of the pre-existing file anyway.

Here is a link to a video walk through:
